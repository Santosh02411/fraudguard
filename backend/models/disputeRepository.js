/**
 * Dispute Repository
 * ====================
 * Feature: chargeback/dispute tracking. alerts.verdict
 * ('confirmed_fraud' / 'false_positive') is FraudGuard's OWN read on a
 * transaction, set by an analyst. A dispute tracks something different
 * and often disconnected from that: what actually happened financially
 * with the card network once a customer (or the analyst, on the
 * customer's behalf) formally disputed the charge. A transaction
 * FraudGuard never even flagged can still be disputed (a customer says
 * "I didn't make this"), and a transaction FraudGuard correctly flagged
 * as fraud can still be lost at chargeback (missing/weak evidence) — the
 * two are related signals, not the same fact, which is why this is its
 * own table rather than another alerts column.
 *
 * Lifecycle (enforced by TRANSITIONS below, not a DB constraint, so it
 * stays portable across dialects the same way fraud_rules is):
 *
 *   opened --> evidence_submitted --> won
 *          \                      \-> lost
 *           \--------------------------> won   (merchant concedes early / no real case)
 *            \-------------------------> lost  (merchant concedes early / no real case)
 *
 * i.e. evidence_submitted is an optional intermediate step, not a
 * required one — real disputes are sometimes resolved without a
 * separate "evidence" step (grace period expires, merchant doesn't
 * contest).
