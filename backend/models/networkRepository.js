/**
 * Network / Graph-Based Fraud Ring Detection
 * =============================================
 * Everything else in this app (fraudEngine.js, mlClient.js) scores ONE
 * transaction at a time, from the perspective of ONE account's own
 * history. That misses a whole class of fraud: coordinated activity
 * across MULTIPLE accounts that individually look unremarkable but
 * share underlying infrastructure — a stolen-card testing farm running
 * many small "trial" transactions across throwaway accounts from one
 * device, or one operator working several fake accounts from one IP.
 *
 * This module builds a graph where accounts are nodes and an edge
 * connects two accounts that have ever shared a device_fingerprint or
 * ip_address, then finds connected components ("clusters"/"rings") via
 * union-find. A cluster is worth surfacing when either:
 *
 *   1. It contains at least one account with CONFIRMED fraud history —
 *      and, critically, this reaches accounts that never directly
 *      shared an identifier with the confirmed-fraud account, only
 *      with an intermediary. That's the actual gap this closes: the
 *      existing dynamic blacklist (transactionRepository.
 *      fraudDeviceAndIpBlacklist) only catches a DIRECT device/IP match
 *      against a confirmed-fraud transaction — a single hop. A ring
 *      launders that by rotating devices/IPs between accounts one hop
 *      at a time; graph clustering catches the whole component instead
 *      of each edge in isolation.
 *   2. It's unusually large with NO confirmed fraud yet — e.g. 5
 *      distinct accounts sharing one device is a topology anomaly
 *      worth a human look even before any of them are confirmed
 *      fraudulent, since that's not a pattern genuine, unrelated
 *      customers produce.
 *
 * HONEST CAVEAT (same one docs/METHODOLOGY.md and ml_service/README.md
 * already flag for the existing device/IP blacklist): device_fingerprint
 * here is a hash of the User-Agent header only (see
 * routes/transactions.js's fingerprintDevice), not a real fingerprinting
 * library. Two genuinely unrelated users on the same browser/OS
 * combination WILL collide on this fingerprint. In production this
 * would sit behind a real fingerprinting signal (FingerprintJS-style, or
 * a commercial device-intelligence vendor) before being trusted as
 * strongly as it's used here; treat device-only edges as a weaker
 * signal than IP-only edges when triaging a ring by hand.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE CAVEAT: detectRings() rebuilds the whole graph from every
 * transaction row on every call. Fine at demo scale (thousands of
 * rows); a real deployment would precompute this on a schedule (or
 * incrementally, via a proper graph store) rather than on the request
 * path — see networkRiskForTransaction's doc comment below.
