/**
 * Rate limiting (express-rate-limit).
 * ======================================
 * A fraud-detection app that doesn't rate-limit its own auth and
 * transaction-scoring endpoints is asking to have its login form
 * brute-forced or its ML scoring pipeline hammered for free. Three tiers:
 *
 *   - authLimiter        — strict. Register/login are the highest-value
 *     target for credential stuffing/brute force.
 *   - transactionLimiter  — moderate. Protects the fraud-scoring pipeline
 *     (which calls out to the ML service) from being used as a cheap
 *     DoS vector, while staying generous enough for legitimate bursts.
 *     Keyed per-API-key when the caller authenticated with one (see
 *     middleware/apiKeyAuth.js), so one service integration's traffic
 *     never shares a bucket with unrelated callers on the same IP.
 *   - generalLimiter      — loose, applied to every route as defense in
 *     depth even where a specific limiter isn't warranted.
 *
 * Limits are configurable via env vars (config/env.js) so staging/
 * production can tune them without a code change.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCALING: the default in-memory store is fine for a single
 * process. Running multiple instances behind a load balancer needs a
 * shared store (e.g. `rate-limit-redis`) or each instance enforces its
 * own independent limit, effectively multiplying the real ceiling by
 * the instance count.

// key can't be throttled independently) and too strict (unrelated
