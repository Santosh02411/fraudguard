/**
 * Runs before the test framework is installed and before any test file
 * is required (Jest's `setupFiles`) — so these env vars are in place
 * before config/env.js's validation runs for the first time. Without
 * this, requiring anything that pulls in config/env.js would either
 * throw (missing JWT_SECRET) or call process.exit(1) (see
 * config/env.js's `fail()`), killing the whole test run.
 *
 * SQLITE_PATH=':memory:' gives each test FILE its own private in-memory
 * SQLite database — Jest sandboxes the module registry per test file by
 * default, so config/database.js (and the connection it opens) is a
 * fresh instance per file, and tests in different files can never see
 * each other's data even though they all use the same ':memory:' path.
